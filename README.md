#Hi Androider,

We are trying to improve an app but we are getting some difficulties to do this.

Maybe you can help us! I'll try to exaplain our problems.

The objective of this app is show a list of images from Flickr Gallery.

We already created a list of images and we are downloading for each image a list of sizes.

#What we are trying to do is:

1) Show a loading view while we are downloading the image list.
2) When click in a item, show the title and the Large size of this image in a details screen.
3) Please if you see some code tips you can write in the code or feel free to improve (like functions that could be private or wrote in a better way)
4) Implement at least 3 UT or UI tests.

#Optionals
4) Change our image item (from our list) to a Jetpack Compose component.
